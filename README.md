Weekaso-year is a twitter bot that posts a message every week showing the number of weeks left in this year, because we all can do we with some less procrastination. 
Filled squares represent weeks that have passed.

Inspired by this [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-19/this-chart-shows-the-life-of-a-typical-american-in-weeks)

(I'll probably add more things in future)
